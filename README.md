# Smart Room Environment Monitor

This Arduino project simulates a smart room monitoring system using:
- DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity
- PIR sensor for motion detection
- Serial output and LED alert for visualization

## Components (Theoretical):
- Arduino Uno
- DHT11 Sensor
- PIR Motion Sensor
- LED (Optional)
- Resistors and jumper wires

## Features:
- Reads temperature and humidity values
- Detects human motion
- Alerts when motion is detected or if temperature crosses threshold
- Easily adaptable for home automation or IoT systems

## Note:
This project is written for demonstration and simulation purposes and can be run in environments like Tinkercad or Proteus without actual hardware.

## Future Improvements:
- Add buzzer or LCD display
- Connect to ESP32 for wireless monitoring
- Integrate with a cloud dashboard
